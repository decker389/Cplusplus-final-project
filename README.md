# Cplusplus-final-project
the final project from the C++ class I took in college.


The final project was to take code the instructor provided; without editing the code provided, and using inheritance to add new features to the game created.
Pointers were also a requirement of the assignment.
New features were:
1. location marker cannot go off the grid;
2. create a random amount of cookies ranging from 1 to 10;
3. when location marker moves over a cookie, remove the cookie from the grid and add it to a cookie count;
4. when all cookies have been picked up, print a congratulations message and terminate the game.
